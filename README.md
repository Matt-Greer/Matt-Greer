- 👋 Hi, I’m @Matt-Greer
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a hobby; I use it for work but I'm not a professional.  For now, the little bit I know is loads of fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Python.  I know a good bit about VBA.  Powershell is useful occasionally.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me → my github username at outlook.com
