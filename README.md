- 👋 Hi, I’m @Matt-Greer
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a hobby, maybe as a career someday.  For now, the little bit I know is loads of fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about PowerShell and VBA is a lifelong study.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me my username at outlook.com

I created this account because, frankly, I was forced to in order to report a crash while using Windows 10 PowerToys.  What a wonderful, wonderful program.  Thank you to all who worked on it!  I have been very curious about Github for quite a while tho.  So, here I am.
